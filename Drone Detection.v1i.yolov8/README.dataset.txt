Here are a few use cases for this project:

1. Air Traffic Control: Integrate the "Drone Detection" model into air traffic control systems to effectively monitor and manage drone activity in certain airspace zones, especially around airports and secured areas, reducing the risk of collisions and maintaining airspace safety.

2. Military and Surveillance: Use the model in military strategies to detect and classify drones for defensive procedures, including identifying potential enemy drones or suspicious activities.

3. Anti-Drone Systems: Incorporate the model within security systems for identifying intrusive drones that violate privacy rules in residential, governmental, or confidential industrial areas. This can trigger appropriate countermeasures, such as alerts or anti-drone devices.

4. Wildlife Research: Utilize the model as part of wildlife monitoring systems to decide when drones are being used to track or study animals, thus identifying potential periods of increased stress for the animals due to drone presence.

5. Event Security: Employ the "Drone Detection" model to manage drone traffic during public events such as concerts or sports matches, ensuring the safety of the attendees by monitoring unauthorized or malicious drone activity.
